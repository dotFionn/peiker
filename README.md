# peiker

This is the sketch I used to run my Peiker microphone on a PC.

I use it on an Arduino Pro Micro clone. It is known **not** to work on an Arduino Nano.

## Usage

1. Install the Joystick library: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary
2. Open the PeikerApp.ino in Arduino IDE and upload it to you Arduino
